"Following [39], we introduce noise-conditioned score function s(x, σ) := ∇x log pσ(x;D) [39] and aim to optimize the following objective given some sequence of annealed smoothing parameters σk, min θ ∑ k σ 2 kEx∼pσk (x;D) [ ∥sθ(x, σk)−∇x log pσk(x;D)∥(2) ] , (9) which has been shown to be equivalent to the denoising-score-matching loss [56].",,

"However, computing likelihoods directly have proven to be difficult for high-dimensional data [39].",,
"Thus, we propose to use approaches that estimate the gradients of the perturbed empirical distribution (score function) directly [39, 38], which have shown promising performance in generative modeling [37] as it bypasses the estimation of the partition function.",,

"The variance exploding (VE) and variance preserving (VP) SDEs [24, 27, 28] are widespread examples satisfying these constraints.",,
"However, ordinary GANs show some limitations when applied to generate “clean” process data, where low confidence variants are due to failures of the monitoring context rather than to adversarial constructions [59].",,
"1 Diffusion Model Diffusion models [35, 13, 36, 17, 15] aims to generate samples from the Gaussian noise by iterative denoising processes.",,
"Nowadays, there are mainly three basic formulations of diffusion models: denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) [85], [90], score matching diffusion models [91], [92], and score SDEs [93], [94].",,
"Thus, the key approach (NCSN, a noise-conditional score network), perturbing data with a noise sequence and jointly estimating the score function for all the noisy data with a deep neural network conditioned on noise levels, is proposed [91].",,

"Subsequently, this line of work developed into score-based diffusion models Song et al. (2020), which can be viewed as a “continuously annealed” version of the approach in Song and Ermon (2019).",,
"On the empirical side, breakthrough work by Song and Ermon (2019) proposed an annealed version of score matching, in which they proposed fitting the scores of the distribution convolved with multiple levels of Gaussian noise.",,
"If L corresponds to a Markov process corresponding to a continuous version of simulated tempering, we show the corresponding generalized score matching loss is a Gaussian-convolution annealed score matching loss, akin to the one proposed in Song and Ermon (2019).",,
"Moreover, Song and Ermon (2019) propose annealing as a fix to another issue: using the score to sample from the distribution using Langevin dynamics is also problematic, as Langevin mixes slowly in the presence of multimodality and low-dimensional manifold structure.",,
"Moreover, the corresponding generalized score matching loss is a form of annealed score matching loss (Song and Ermon, 2019; Song et al., 2020), with a particular choice of weighing for the different amounts of Gaussian convolution.",,

"Furthermore, there exist two appealing properties of using diffusion models [31]–[33] for unsupervised feature learning of hyperspectral data: 1) diffusion models learn implicit mappings, which have superior representation ability on complex problems via simple expressions and extract both high-level and low-level features from images; 2) the stepwise reverse denoising process of diffusion models are modeled as an iterative optimization process optimized by Langevin dynamics.",,

"Of these, diffusion models Song et al. (2020) provide the most general framework for score-based sampling, as well as a means to recover pθ by solving an ordinary differential equation (ODE).",,
"Perhaps most similar to our approach is Jayaram & Thickstun (2021), who also suggest sampling via the score function with Langevin dynamics, but they crucially do not train with noise, which Song & Ermon (2019) found to be essential for stable sampling in a Langevin algorithm.",,

"Since we do not hope to see Gaussian noise in our final-sampled images (i.e., beyond the level of intrinsic noise in the observations), it is beneficial to decay the noise level, as in score-based models (Song & Ermon, 2019).",,
"Among various kinds of generative models, the score-based model and diffusion type models have gained much success in image generation recently (Song & Ermon, 2019; Song et al., 2021b; 2020; Song & Ermon, 2020; Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015; Nichol & Dhariwal, 2021; Bao et al., 2022; Rombach et al.,…",,

learn without the annealing process to the noise distribution (Song & Ermon, 2019).",,

"However, if the graph structure is corrupted, especially when the non-trivial perturbation is conducted [23], the GNN encoder would inevitably be affected, leading to noisy node representations.",,

"Besides sequential generation, UDOP can also generate vision documents by leveraging masked autoencoders (MAE) [14] by reconstructing the document image from text and layout modalities.",,
"Originally, MAE masks a percentage of the image patches and feed non-masked patches into a vision encoder.",,
"For the vision decoder, we adopt the decoder of MAE [14] and directly generate the image pixels with text and layout information.",,
We adopt the MAE objective [14] for vision selfsupervised learning.,,
MAE uses mean squared error and apply loss only on masked patches.,,
"Thus, here we directly apply a standard masked image modeling (MIM) pipeline [5, 19, 48] for training, illustrated in Figure 2.",,
"community [32, 38] and previous works [5, 19, 48] to use a learnable token vector to replace each masked patch.",,
"We show that LOCA yields improved performance over state-of-the-art supervised [53,60,65] and unsupervised [13,17,34,84] representation learning methods for ViTs when transferred to 11 diverse and challenging semantic segmentation benchmarks.",,
"Specifically, the task is to reconstruct masked [6] or dropped [34] patches from the input sequence tokens, either directly in pixel space [34] or in feature space [6,69,84].",,
"This is +4.8 points above the best self-supervised competitor, MAE, and +3.1 points above supervised pretraining with DeiT-3.",,
"For example, dense contrastive approaches adapt the popular contrastive SSL paradigm to the patch level [52, 55, 68, 72, 73] while masked autoencoders propose to reconstruct masked patches [6, 34].",,
"Following the standard protocol of the Vision Transformers [26], query and reference views are divided into non overlapping patches of resolution P × P .",,
"In terms of training efficiency, based on our implementation, one LOCA epoch takes 17.4 minutes while one MAE epoch takes 5.7 minutes.",,
"Hence, LOCA achieves an improvement of +4.3 points over MAE while being only 1.1× longer to pretrain.",,
"By contrast, models trained with a spatially-aware objective such as MAE or LOCA produce more spatially accurate predictions.",,
"Indeed, we have observed that freezing the backbone and training a linear classifier on top of MAE features perform very poorly [34].",,
"However, LOCA reaches 82.1% average relative improvement over random initialization in 600 epochs while MAE reaches 77.8% in 2.6× more epochs (1600).",,
"In this section, we compare LOCA to popular state-ofthe-art SSL models for ViTs: DINO [13], MoCo-v3 [17], MAE [34] and iBOT [84].",,
"Of particular interest, MAE representations achieve the second best SSL performance.",,
"Interestingly, Caron et al. [13] have shown that segmentation masks emerge from the attention maps of Vision Transformers (ViT) [26] trained with these contrastive methods and several works have built on this observation to generate completely unsupervised segmentations [33, 58, 85].",,
"Recently, patchlevel SSL pretrainings have attracted more and more attention in the community [5, 6, 34, 70, 74, 80].",,
"Recently, masked auto-encoders revisit this “inpainting” approach to pretraining Vision Transformers [6, 34, 69].",,
"In particular, compared to human-generated sources such as natural languages, which are highly semantic and information-dense [10], images typically require larger transmission bandwidth, and are generally natural signals with a lot of spatial redundant information, thus efficient image semantic communications deserve investigations.",,
"Under the longer training schedule (800 epochs), our model reaches 83.9% accuracy, 0.4% higher than MAE (He et al. 2021) and
0.9% higher than RandSAC (Hua et al. 2022) (a concurrent autoregressive work of ours).",,
"For linear probing, we use the feature of the last block and adopt an extra BatchNorm (Ioffe and Szegedy 2015) layer before the linear classifier following MAE.",,
"2020), recent works (He et al. 2021; Bao, Dong, and Wei 2021; Wei et al. 2021; Xie et al. 2021) introduce BERT-style pretraining by reconstructing the masked patches, which achieve an overall improvement in downstream tasks and greatly narrow the gap between vision and language.",,
"We followed the pre-training parameters in MAE (He et al. 2021) and MaskFeat (Wei et al. 2021) without using color jittering, drop path, and gradient clip.",,
"Our model pretrained with 300 epochs achieves the same accuracy as MAE (He et al. 2021) pretrained with 1600 epochs, which indicates that our method converges faster in the pretraining stage.",,
"According to the MAE, reducing the number of image masks can improve reconstruction results, but it will decrease model representation due to image local dependency.",,
"We observe that our method achieves 47.8 mIoU, which is slightly lower than MAE by 0.3, but higher than all others.",,
"3, we discovered that MAE masked out 75% of the image tokens, resulting in blurred reconstruction results in large masked regions.",,
MAE (He et al. 2021) masks a high proportion of the input image and just predicts raw pixels.,,
"We note that BEIT and MAE are pretrained with 1600 epochs and use grid-search to find the best hyperparameters, while we only pretrain 800 epochs and don’t tune any parameters in the fine-tune stage due to limited access to computation.",,
"3, shows that the baby in the image is ignored by MAE because it’s totally masked, but SAIM can efficiently generate the baby in the image.",,
"The patch-based iGPT achieves 82.70 Top1 accuracy, which is higher than DeiT-base (Touvron et al. 2021)(81.8) but still lags behind the MIM method (e.g. 83.6 for MAE).",,
"While, our proposed stochastic autoregressive image modeling, SAIM, utilizes all the information of the image to generate clear images, and achieve better fine-tuning accuracy than MAE on ImageNet-1K.",,
"Given a partly masked image, the network is trained to reconstruct properties of the masked areas such as VAE features [2, 17, 51], HOG features [93], or color information [29, 99].",,

"Different from [4, 16, 23, 46], we do not apply masked prediction on video and text but directly apply the cross-modal contrastive loss to pull video and text together.",,
"This is consistent with the conclusions of MAE [23] and BERT [4]: the information density of image is low, and the information density of text is high.",,

"This is consistent with the conclusions of MAE [23] and BERT [4]: the information density of image is low, and the

"Benefiting from the success of the transformer architecture in the computer vision domain, recent methods [4,23] draw inspiration from MLM and propose a masked visual modeling (MVM) technique to randomly mask a high portion of spatial patches and encode with visible patches, which greatly reduces spatial redundancy.",,
This suggests that the masked-thenprediction paradigm in MAE [23] is inconsistent with the goal of retrieval tasks.,,

"In contrast, as a reference and with the same computational resources, VideoMAE requires about 27.7 hours to improve its performance of 0.5% through fine-tuning from its 800 to 1600 epochs checkpoint, and ρBYOL needs at least 48 hours to improve of 0.4% its linear probing performance from its 200 to 400 epochs checkpoint.",,
"Similar to MAE [25], we found that applying a batch normalization layer [30] without affine transformations is beneficial for VideoMAE models.",,
"This is in contrast to MAE-based SSL methods for vision, where the proposed pseudo-tasks are based on the reconstruction of the whole input [16, 19, 25, 54], and even if the loss uses a subset of the tokens (the masked ones) for the loss calculation, the remaining tokens are still part of the decoder’s output and computation graph.",,

"Table 1: Comparison of State-of-the-Art (SOTA) Methods on TrackingNet [20] and GOT-10k [21] Datasets: The evaluated methods include ""DT"" (Dynamic Template) and ""EB"" (Extra Branch to update Dynamic Templates), along with different initialization methods, such as ""RandomNone"" and pre-training with additional datasets, such as ""CLIP-WIT [29]"", ""CLS-ImageNet-1k [30]"", ""CLS-ImageNet-22k [31]"", or ""MAE-ImageNet1k [28]"".",,
Implementation Details We implement the proposed ProContEXT using PyTorch and utilize the ViT-base backbone that is pre-trained by MAE [28].,,
"As mentioned in Section 1, we follow a similar approach to the work put forth in [7], where masked autoencoders reconstructed images with large amounts of masking.",,
"Unlike [7], we don’t remove the masked patches from the input to the encoder and provide positional information to the input of the decoder.",,
"Recently, there has been some major breakthroughs in image reconstruction using masked autoencoders [7], where an image can be realistically reconstructed with 90% of it being masked in patches.",,
"We denote the former as “speech branch” and the latter as “text branch”, where the former can be viewed as a masked autoencoder [28] and the latter is TTS.",,
"Recently, BEiT[33] and MAE[34] utilized a BERT-style pre-training as part of the visual learner, and they discovered that models are effective at learning semantics with such a scheme.",,
"Recently, BEiT [33] and MAE [34] utilize a BERT-style pre-training as part of the visual learner, and they discover that models are effective at learning semantics with such a scheme.",,
"It is worth noting that both DistilHuBERT and FitHuBERT are investigated under the contrained track on the SUPERB benchmark, which might not be able to reflect the potential effect of the distilled model as it does not fully explore the powerful modeling capacity lied in the Transformer encoder and merely treats it as a frozen feature extractor during the whole fine-tuning stage, missing the opportunity to pursue strong but non-linear features [19].",,
"Specifically, we propose an SSL model, MAEEG, inspired by both BENDR and the MAE model proposed in computer vision [He et al., 2022], to compare with BENDR and to broaden our understanding of reconstruction-based SSL for EEG.",,
"While this result may not be intuitive, the same trend was observed in computer vision where masking more of the signal during SSL pretraining could result in better downstream performance [He et al., 2022].",,
This study was inspired by MAE [1] for an MIM and Bootstrap Your Own Latent [12] (BYOL) as a framework for directly learning la-,,
"Among them, Masked Autoencoders [1] (MAE) have inspired numerous subsequent studies and influenced not only the image domain [2–5] but also the audio domain [6–9].",,
"While we use the same positional encoding as MAE [1], we tested various masking ratios as discussed in Section 4.",,
"Similar with MAE [15], the decoder of CAAE is only used in pre-training CAAE to perform image reconstruction task.",,
"As MAE [15] indicates, the design of the decoder architecture can be flexible and independent of the encoder design.",,
"Unlike in [2], the model is trained to reconstruct the full image as a mixture of individual component reconstructions.",,
"In this work, we capitalize in particular on the masked autoencoding of [2] and investigate using it for object-centric learning.",,
"Then, exactly as in MAE [2], we add a learnable mask token at the positions of the masked tokens and the sine-cosine position embeddings.",,
"We therefore choose the random masking strategy, exactly as in MAE [2].",,
"Another example is the object-reasoning-like results seen in the predictions of masked image-modelling frameworks [2, 3].",,
"Just as in MAE [2], we add fixed sine-cosine postional encodings from [23] to the embeddings of the patches.",,
Our model has a narrower bottleneck in comparison to MAE [2].,,
"We hypothesize that the object-reasoning-like behaviour demonstrated to appear in the self-supervision task of masked image modelling [2, 3] can be utilized also for explicit object-centric representation learning.",,
Our broadcasting module takes inspiration both from the MAE decoder [2] and from the spatial broadcast decoder [25] used in several object-learning models [9–14].,,
Our model is inspired by the transformer-based masked autoencoder [2] with modifications to enable end-to-end unsupervised multi-object segmentation and representation learning.,,
"More specifically, we adapt the Masked Autoencoder (MAE) [2] design and modify it to for explicit object-centric representation learning and segmentation.",,
This is in line with recent findings on training transformers that show the effectiveness of supervising multiple output tokens instead of just a single [CLS] token [73].,,
"PowerBERT is adopted from BERT model [16, 19, 20] to extract the high-dimensional representations from the massive unlabeled data.",,
[17] used Vision Transformers [7] for masked image inpainting and reconstruction.,,
"Denoising autoencoders [15] are a recent deep-learning method demonstrated to reconstruct original images from their corrupted versions across a variety of perturbations, from salt-and-pepper noise [16] to image masking [17].",,
"Similarly, while ViT has been shown to outperform CNNs on large datasets [17], we observe that ViT outputs contain uneven pixelation when decoding the 16 × 16 patch embeddings, resulting in its low SSIM score.",,
"While [55, 8, 23, 5, 20, 10] have adopted CNN as pretraining backbones, recent works [6, 50, 11, 22, 29, 28] have explored Transformers [46] for self-supervised visual learning, demonstrating their superiority over traditional CNN.",,
"Despite no labels, models trained with self-supervision have outperformed their supervised counterparts on several downstream tasks, such as image classification [19, 55, 8, 23, 9, 5, 20, 10, 6, 50, 11, 22] and object detection [53, 7].",,
"For MAE He et al. (2022), a method based on a reconstruction objective, we select an attention-based ViT encoder.",,
