"Therefore, for p2, the interval for training is [1, 11) (the last 10 days) and for p1, the interval is [0, 11), since the scheduled interval of p1 (30 days) is larger than the available data (Figure 6a).",0,negative

"Therefore, reusing a model does not replace its computation, but reduces the training time [1, 52].",1,neutral
"On the second execution (on the interval [1, 31)), since mean and variance can be computed incrementally, we reuse the mean and variance of the interval [1, 30) and only compute the mean and variance of [30, 31).",1,neutral

"Note that materializing a vertex such as ⟨Var-f, [0, 10)⟩ does not break the dependency of its descendants (e.g., ⟨Var-t, [0, 10)⟩) from its ancestors (e.g., ⟨Scale-t, [0, 10)⟩), since there are more than one path connecting the ancestors to the descendants.",1,neutral
